## Introduction

**The Merkle Trees** is a decentralized cloud storage solution designed to provide secure and resilient data storage. By
utilizing IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and MongoDB, this project enables decentralized data storage and management,
mitigating the risks associated with centralized cloud solutions.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilizes IPFS for distributed data storage.
- **Enhanced Security**: Data is encrypted and distributed across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data loss.
- **Scalability**: The system can easily scale to accommodate increasing data volumes.
- **Modern Frontend**: User interface developed with Blazor WebAssembly.
- **Robust API**: RESTful API built with ASP.Net Core.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PierreAnders/TheMerkleTrees.git
   cd the-merkle-trees
   ```

2. **Configure IPFS**

   Ensure your local IPFS node is running:
   ```bash
   ipfs init
   ipfs daemon
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB**
     ```bash
     MongoDB": {
      "ConnectionString": "your_connection_string",
      "DatabaseName": "your_db_name"
      },
      ```

4. **Run the project***
   ```bash
   cd TheMerkleTrees.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage
